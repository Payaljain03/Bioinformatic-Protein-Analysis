#About the project
This project involves the computational analysis of an uncharacterized protein **A0A0H2Z666 (yjgQ)** from **_Escherichia coli_** O1:K1 using bioinformatics tools. I performed:
BLASTp homology search
Domain Search and GO Term analysis (InterProScan , QuickGO)
Structural Analysis (PSI-PRED, SWISS-MODEL)
Protein binding-site predictions (COACH-D , F-pocket server)
Structural Visualization (PyMOL)

This project predicts that **yjgQ** protein is an LPS transport-associated permease protein, involved in E.coli bacterialouter membrane biogenesis.
